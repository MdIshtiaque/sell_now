SellNow: Project Instructions
You are given a partially complete PHP application (Digital Marketplace). This is
not a finished product. It is a "working" prototype, but it lacks an architectural
soul. It was built by a developer who focused on what the code does, rather than
how the code lives.
Your task is to take this raw material and introduce engineering maturity. We do
not want a feature-complete app; we want a demonstration of your professional
standard.
The Constraints
No Frameworks: You are not allowed to use Laravel, Symfony, or similar. You
must define the architecture yourself.
Evolution, Not Erasure: Do not delete everything and start over. Show us how
you refactor and bridge the gap between "legacy" and "modern."
Tooling: You have Composer and the PHP 8.x ecosystem at your disposal.
Use them wisely.
Our Interest: Your Philosophy
We have intentionally left the "requirements" vague. We aren't looking for a
specific set of features; we are looking for your perspective on the following:
SellNow: Project Instructions 1
The Responsibility of a Component: Where does logic belong? We want to
see how you decide what a Controller, a Model, or a Service should actually
"know" about the rest of the system.
The Contract of Data: How do you ensure data remains valid and predictable
as it moves from a raw HTTP request into the persistence layer?
The Interface of Change: How do you design parts of the system (like
Payments or Notifications) so they can be swapped or extended without a
total system collapse?
The Ethics of Security: How do you approach the inherent dangers of the web
when a framework isn't there to protect you by default?
The Clarity of Intent: Can a stranger read your Git history and code structure
and immediately understand your mental model of this business?
Structural Scalability: How do you organize a codebase to ensure that adding
the 100th feature is as easy as adding the 5th? We want to see how you
decouple components to prevent the "spaghetti" effect.
Pragmatic Performance: Where are the bottlenecks? We are looking for your
ability to identify expensive operations (N+1 queries, heavy loops, or
redundant I/O) and your philosophy on writing "lean" code without overoptimizing prematurely.
The Enforcement of Best Practices: In an environment without a framework to
guide you, how do you enforce consistency, type safety, and modern
standards? Show us what "Clean Code" means to you in a raw PHP context.
The Deliverable
1. Refactored Source Code: Hosted on a Git platform of your choice.
2. The "Manifesto" (README): We value this as much as the code. It should
articulate:
The Audit: Your honest critique of the inherited mess.
The Priority Matrix: Why did you choose to refactor X instead of Y?
The Trade-offs: Every architectural choice has a cost. What did you
sacrifice for the sake of your chosen design?

Expectations
We suggest max 3 days. This is a prioritization exercise. If you spend the whole
time perfecting the Directory Structure and never touch the Database logic, that
tells us something about your philosophy. If you fix the Security but leave the code
messy, that tells us something else.
Final Note
This project simulates a real-world inherited codebase.
There are:
Inconsistencies
Shortcuts
Imperfections
That is intentional.
We want to see how you handle reality, not idealized perfection.
Show us what you value most.
